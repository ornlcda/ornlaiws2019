Lawrence Carin earned the BS, MS, and PhD degrees in electrical engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1985, 1986, and 1989, respectively. In 1989 he joined the Electrical Engineering Department at Polytechnic University (Brooklyn) as an Assistant Professor, and became an Associate Professor there in 1994. In September 1995 he joined the Electrical Engineering Department at Duke University, where he is now a Professor, and Vice Provost for Research. From 2003-2014 he held the William H. Younger Distinguished Professorship, and he was ECE Department Chair from 2011-2014. Dr Carin's early research was in the area of electromagentics and sensing, and over the last 15 years his research has moved to applied statistics and machine learning. He has recently served on the Program Committee for the following machine learning conferences: International Conf. on Machine Learning (ICML), Neural and Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), and Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI). He was previously an Associate Editor (AE) of the IEEE Trans. on Antennas and Propagation, the IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, and the SIAM J. of Imaging Science. He is currently an AE for the J. of Machine Learning Research. He is an IEEE Fellow.

Generally, people know me as Ramki. I am a Computational Data Scientist in Oak Ridge National Laboratory focusing on large scale data mining and machine learning algorithms on HPC systems and modern architectures with applications from scientific domain and many different internet services. I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology(GaTech) advised by Prof. Haesun Park. Prior to Ph.D., I worked on Data Analytics group at IBM TJ Watson Research Center and was an IBM Master Inventor. Under the advise of Prof. Narahari, I graduated from Indian Institute of Science with M.Sc (Engg). For more information visit https://ramkikannan.github.io
