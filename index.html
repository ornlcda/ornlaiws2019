The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has solved several grand challenge
problems in recent years, ranging from facial recognition, to language translation, to autonomously driving cars. These staggering breakthroughs have resulted from very large sets of labeled data, very large clusters of GPU processors, and increasingly complex neural network models. The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers from ORNL and its core universities in artificial intelligence to present new research and to develop new collaborations to significantly advances the field of AI and to accelerate scientific discoveries.
